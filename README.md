# Foretoken AI - Real-Work Coding Assessment

Welcome! You’ve been invited to complete a short, real-world coding challenge designed to reflect the kind of work you might actually do on the job.

## ⏱️ Assessment Format & Rules

- You have **60 minutes** from the time you receive the zip file.
- You are **required to record your full screen and camera via Zoom** during the assessment.
  - Please start a Zoom meeting (just with yourself), turn on your camera, and begin recording.
  - Incomplete recordings may disqualify your submission.
- You **may use any AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)** — just like you would at work.
- **Do not collaborate with another person.** This is a solo assessment.
- You’ll receive a **reminder email 15 minutes before your time is up**.

## 💻 What You’ll Work On

You’ll be working inside a small, realistic codebase in Node.js/Express. The goal is not to finish everything, but to make strong, thoughtful progress.

You’ll be working on the following 4 tasks — complete as many as you can within the time limit:

1. **Fix a Bug**  
   `GET /users/:id` returns the wrong user when given an invalid ID format.

2. **Extend an API**  
   Add support for query filtering: `/users?status=active&team=marketing`

3. **Build a Feature**  
   Add `GET /users/inactive` to return users with no login activity in the last 30+ days.

4. **Write Tests**  
   Add integration tests for any endpoint.

## 📦 What to Submit

By the end of the hour, please reply to this email with:

1. ✅ A zip of your modified project folder
2. 📹 Your full Zoom recording file
3. 📝 A short response (in the email body) answering:
   - Which tasks did you choose?
   - What AI tools did you use, and how?
   - Given more time, what else would you improve or complete?
   - Any additional thoughts or feedback on the task?

## 💡 What We’re Evaluating

We’re not just looking for perfect code. We’re looking at:
- Your ability to navigate a real codebase
- How you use AI as a tool (not a crutch)
- Prioritization and decision-making
- Communication and clarity of thought

Good luck!
