# Foretoken AI - Real-Work Coding Assessment

Welcome! You’ve been invited to complete a short, real-world coding challenge designed to reflect the kind of work you might actually do on the job.

## 📋 What You Need to Know

- Your **screen and audio recording** has already started (via your browser).
- Please **do not close or refresh the assessment tab** — doing so will stop the recording and may void your submission.
- You may use **any AI tools** (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- This is a **solo** exercise — no pair programming or external help allowed.

If you encounter issues, contact our team at **[assessment@foretokenai.com](mailto:assessment@foretokenai.com)** immediately.

## 💻 What You’ll Work On

You’ll be working inside a small, realistic codebase in Node.js/Express. The goal is not to finish everything, but to make strong, thoughtful progress.

You’ll be working on the following 4 tasks — complete as many as you can within the time limit:

1. **Fix a Bug**  
   `GET /users/:id` returns the wrong user when given an invalid ID format.

2. **Extend an API**  
   Add support for query filtering: `/users?status=active&team=marketing`

3. **Build a Feature**  
   Add `GET /users/inactive` to return users with no login activity in the last 30+ days.

4. **Write Tests**  
   Add integration tests for any endpoint.

## 📦 What to Submit

After the timer ends, the platform will ask you to:

1. 📁 Upload your modified project as a `.zip`
2. 🎤 Record a **short reflection video** (up to 2 minutes) in your browser

## 💡 What We’re Evaluating

We’re not just looking for perfect code. We’re looking at:
